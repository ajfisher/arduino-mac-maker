Arduino Mac Maker
=================

This application was designed to simplify having a lot of different networked arduinos on the same network. A networked arduino requires custom creation of a MAC address and these MAC addresses must be unique on the network or routing conflicts will occur.

As networking creation headers typically get copied from one application to another it becomes increasingly likely to end up with a MAC address conflict if you are using many arduinos on the same network.

Arduino Mac Maker keeps a track of each of your arduinos by task and holds all of the information, network address, MAC address, routing details etc so you can just copy and paste the header into your sketch for use.

Installation
